        access the Site [or our mobile application], your personal information is not collected through the use of

        be aware that such action could affect the availability and functionality of the Site [or our mobile
        application]. You may not decline web beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all

        <h3>Website Analytics</h3>
        We may also partner with selected third-party vendors[, such as [Adobe Analytics,] [Google Analytics,] and
        others], to allow tracking technologies and remarketing services on the Site [and our mobile application]
        through the use of first party cookies and third-party cookies, to, among other things, analyze and track users’
        use of the Site [and our mobile application], determine the popularity of certain content and better understand
        online activity. By accessing the Site [or our mobile application], you consent to the collection and use of
        your information by these third-party vendors. You are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact
        them directly for responses to your questions. We do not transfer personal information to these third-party
        vendors. However, if you do not want any information to be collected and used by tracking technologies, you can

        Opt-Out Tool.
        You should be aware that getting a new computer, installing a new browser, upgrading an existing browser, or

        <h2>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h2>
        The Site [and our mobile application] may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest,
        including advertisements and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links
        to leave the Site [or our mobile application], any information you provide to these third parties is not covered
        by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information. Before visiting and
        providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and
        practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in
        your discretion, protect the privacy of your information. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and
        security practices and policies of any third parties, including other sites, services or applications that may
        be linked to or from the Site [or our mobile application].
        <h2>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information.
        While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that
        despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be
        guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to
        interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide
        personal information.
        <h2>POLICY FOR CHILDREN</h2>
        We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of
        any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided
        below.
        <h2>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES </h2>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems [and our mobile applications] include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
        feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
        browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
        signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
        that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
        Privacy Policy. Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems [and our mobile applications] include a
        Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. If you set the DNT signal on your browser, we
        will respond to such DNT browser signals.
        <h2>OPTIONS REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        You may at any time review or change the information in your account or terminate your account by:
        <ul>

            <li>Contacting us using the contact information provided below</li>
        </ul>
        Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our
        active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot
        problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.
        <h3>Emails and Communications</h3>
        If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails, or other communications from us, you may opt-out by:

        <h2>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are
